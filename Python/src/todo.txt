TODO:
(Must)
- Simplify main module code.  Fewer lines, shorter names.
(Should)
- HUD
-- cooldowns
-- labels
- Add collision explosions.  Could be so freaking cool.
- Move infrequent metrics to config.GameData class so that things can be tuned more easily.
- Find / fix bug where weapons stop firing, sound goes nuts (super loud and wrong) and 
  shards start flying in  from every corner in unreasonable numbers.
